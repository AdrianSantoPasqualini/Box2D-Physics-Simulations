This simulation demonstrates how an initially chaotic system with planets orbiting in different directions evenentually 
stabilizes. The planets fall into stable orbits all moving in the same direction.

Let the boxes fall halfway down the screen to gain some initial velocity and then hold space to apply a gravitational force
towards the center.
