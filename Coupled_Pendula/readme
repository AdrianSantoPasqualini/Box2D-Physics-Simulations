This is a spring coupled pendula system. The two pendulums are connected via a spring and one is given an initial 
displacement to the right. As the right pendulum oscillates it transfers kinetic energy through the spring to the other 
pendulum. Eventually, a full energy transfer will occur and the right pendulum will be motionless. At this point, the left 
pendlum will oscillate with an max amplitude equal to the initial displacement of the right pendulum. This cycle will continue
to repeat and energy will be transferred between the pendula until it is lost to damping forces.
