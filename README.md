# Box2D-Physics-Simulations
These are a series of physics simulations that I made using the Box2D physics engine. Most of them are ones that I made for lab reports when I couldn't find any simulations that I liked online. Some of them are ones that I just made for fun or to test out different features.  Written in Processing 3.
